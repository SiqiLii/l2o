    - If you want to pick a cube: first move the gripper above the cube and then lower it to be able to grasp the cube:
        Here's an example if you want to pick a cube:
        ~~~
        1. Go to a position above the cube
        2. Go to the position of the cube
        3. Close gripper

        ~~~
    - If you want to drop a cube: open the gripper and then move the gripper above the cube so to avoid collision. 
        Here's an example if you want to drop a cube at a location:
        ~~~
        1. Go to a position above the desired location
